Quantum-inspired algorithms to solve systems of linear equations
and to implement recommendation systems

The repository contains all source code used to generate results
presented in `"Quantum-inspired algorithms in practice" <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10415>`_.

Contents
========

* ``quantum_inspired.py``: a Python module containing all functions composing the
  quantum-inspired algorithm. It contains three driver subroutines
  to use the implemented algorithms for the following applications:
  i)   solving a system of linear equations Ax = b,
  ii)  portfolio optimization,
  iii) recommendation systems.

Usage and examples
==================

Below we describe usage of the module to tackle these applications.
First thing to do is to import the module. All input data required to
run these examples have been included in the repository.

1. Solving a system linear of equations Ax = b.

   .. code-block:: python
      
      import quantum_inspired as qi
      import numpy as np
      
      # load a low-rank random matrix A with dimension 500 x 250
      A = np.load('A.npy')
      # load b vector (500 x 1) defining linear system Ax=b
      b = np.load('b.npy')
      # rank of matrix A
      rank = 3
      # Input parameters for the quantum inspired algorithm
      r = 200
      c = 200
      Nsamples = 50
      NcompX = 50
      sampled_comp, x = qi.linear_eqs(A, b, r, c, rank, Nsamples, NcompX)

Args:

* ``A``: In general, a rectangular matrix
* ``b``: right-hand-side vector b
* ``r``: number of sampled rows from matrix A
* ``c``: number of sampled columns from matrix A
* ``rank``: rank of matrix A
* ``Nsamples``: number of stochastic samples performed to estimate coefficients ``lambda_l``
* ``NcompX``: number of entries to be sampled from the solution vector ``x_tilde``

Returns:
    Tuple containing arrays with the ``NcompX`` sampled entries and corresponding components of
    the solution vector ``x_tilde``.


2. Portfolio optimization.

   .. code-block:: python

      import quantum_inspired as qi
      import numpy as np
      
      # Reading the correlation matrix
      corr_mat = np.load('SnP500_correlation.npy')
      # Reading vector of historical returns
      hist_returns = np.load('SnP500_returns.npy')

      mu = np.mean(hist_returns[:])

      n_assets = len(hist_returns[:])
      m_rows = n_assets + 1
      n_cols = n_assets + 1

      A = np.zeros((m_rows, n_cols))
      # Building the matrix A
      # In this case, matrix A is a block squared matrix of dimension 475 x 475
      # composed by the vector of historical returns r and correlation matrix \Sigma
      # of 474 assets comprised in the S&P 500 stock index.
      A[0, 0] = 0
      A[0, 1:n_cols] = hist_returns[:]
      A[1:m_rows, 0] = hist_returns[:]

      A[1:m_rows, 1:n_cols] = corr_mat[:, :]

      # b is a vector [\mu, \vec 0] with \mu being the expected return
      b = np.zeros(m_rows)
      b[0] = mu

      # This defines a portfolio optimization problem Ax = b
      # where x = [\nu, \vec{\omega}] and \vec{\omega} is the
      # portfolio allocation vector

      # low-rank approximation of matrix A
      rank = 5
      # Input parameters for the quantum inspired algorithm
      r = 340
      c = 340
      Nsamples = 10
      NcompX = 10

      # Notice that this function receives "mu" instead of the whole vector "b"
      # as the general coefficient <v_l|A^+|b> reduces to the inner product <mu*A_0., v_l>.
      # The latter allow us to reduce significantly the number of stochastic samples performed
      # to estimate "lambdas[0:rank]".
      sampled_comp, x = qi.linear_eqs_portopt(A, mu, r, c, rank, Nsamples, NcompX)

Args:

* ``A``: In general, a rectangular matrix
* ``b``: right-hand-side vector b
* ``r``: number of sampled rows from matrix A
* ``c``: number of sampled columns from matrix A
* ``rank``: rank of matrix A
* ``Nsamples``: number of stochastic samples performed to estimate coefficients ``lambda_l``
* ``NcompX``: number of entries to be sampled from the solution vector ``x_tilde``

Returns:
    Tuple containing arrays with the ``NcompX`` sampled entries and corresponding components of
    the solution vector ``x_tilde``.

3. Recommendation system.

   .. code-block:: python
   
      import quantum_inspired as qi
      import numpy as np
      
      # load a preference matrix A of dimension m x n encoding the rates
      # provided by m = 611 users for n = 9724 movies
      A = np.load('A_movies_small.npy')

      # In this example we want to reconstruct the full row of matrix A corresponding
      # to a specific user (416 in this case) and use highest components of the
      # reconstructed row vector to recommend new movies
      user = 416

      # low-rank approximation
      rank = 10
      # Input parameters for the quantum inspired algorithm
      r = 450
      c = 4500
      Nsamples = 10
      NcompX = 10
      sampled_comp, x = qi.recomm_syst(A, user, r, c, rank, Nsamples, NcompX)

Args:

* ``A``: preference matrix
* ``user``: row index of a specific user in the preference matrix A
* ``r``: number of sampled rows from matrix A
* ``c``: number of sampled columns from matrix A
* ``rank``: rank of matrix A
* ``Nsamples``: number of stochastic samples performed to estimate coefficients ``lambda_l``
* ``NcompX``: number of entries to be sampled from the solution vector ``A[user, :]``

Returns:
    Tuple containing arrays with the ``NcompX`` sampled entries and corresponding elements of
    the row vector ``A[user, :]``.
